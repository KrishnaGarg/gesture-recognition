# Hand-Gesture Recognition

#### About

Gesture recognition is the process of understanding and interpreting meaningful movements of the hands, arms, face, or sometimes head. It can help users to control or interact with devices without physically touching them. 
In this project, hand gestures (finger counts) are recognized from a live video sequence / images using Contours and Deep learning techniques. 

#### How to run

Approach 1: 
It is advised to use the below versions for the following libraries for smooth running of the application.
opencv version- 3.4.2
imutils version- 0.4.6
numpy version- 1.18.1
sklearn version- 0.22.1

Once you have the required libraries, run the code using the following command `python gesture_recognition_contours.py`

To run approach 2: `python gesture_recognition_cnn.py`
